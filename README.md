Proyecta Minds is a MERN stack-based real-time project collaboration platform designed for college students and developers. It allows users to create, manage, and contribute to coding projects seamlessly in a team environment. Key features include a real-time code editor (powered by Docker), chat-based collaboration, permission-based code merging, and a project approval workflow.

🎯 Objective
To simplify remote project collaboration by combining real-time communication, role-based project management, and secure code execution in one unified platform.


🔥 Core Features
🔐 User authentication (JWT & bcrypt)

👥 Role-based access: Project Leader, Collaborators, Admin

🧠 Real-time collaborative code editor (Docker-based execution)

📂 Project creation, collaboration requests, approval flow

💬 Live chat system for project members

🔄 Merge approval system for proposed code changes

🛠 Admin dashboard with real-time updates on project creation

🧾 Docker integration for secure backend code execution

🌐 Deployment-ready architecture using Railway, Render, etc.

🧩 Project Structure
/frontend       → React frontend
/backend        → Node.js + Express API
/docker         → Docker execution handler
/models         → Mongoose schemas
/routes         → API routes
/controllers    → Logic for each feature
/socket         → Socket.IO config

🧪 How to Run Locally
Clone Repo
git clone https://github.com/giddearyan12/proyecta-minds.git

Install Backend
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
Install Frontend
cd ../frontend
